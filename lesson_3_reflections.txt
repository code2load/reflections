1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is desirable when you want to share with the public, allow access to collaborators, access your content from other devices, or to backup to the cloud.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A manual pull is preferred so that changes pushed to GitHub by a collaborator don't conflict with local changes you may be making, or surprise you. You may also want to operate locally with a particular version, and not necessarilly the latest and greatest on the remote.
